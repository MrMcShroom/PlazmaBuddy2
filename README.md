# PlazmaBuddy2
 The second version of PlazmaBuddy, a pretty modular bot that's overall easy to upgrade and is packed full of PB2 features.
 
 # Requirements
 This bot requires node js. It runs on discord js v12 and Mongo DB. I am open sourcing it at the last second.
 You must rename example env file to just '.env' in order for bot to work.
 # Licensing
 MIT license, meaning you are free to change and update, redistribute and commercialize at will, however I cannot be held liable for any faults with the programming.
 #Thanks
 Thanks to Eric Gurt for the API key and the people in the various programming discords always available to hammer away at any problem. It wouldn't have been possible without you.
